<h1>the fix is in</h1>
<h2>by connor shioshita pickett</h2>


<br><br><br>


<p>There are four tall banners speared into the dirt outside. Four shining aluminum pipes, fourteen feet tall, with a curve at the end like a birdfeather, each with a length of orange fabric reaching from the tip nearly to the ground. Each of them looks like a quill plucked from some enormous, extinct bird, hunted to a quick end for its proud and precious plumage. Each banner displays our name in black: Conviction Cycling. </p>
<p>	In the morning I we pull up in the alley, and my attendant unlocks the back door for me. We go in through the workshop and he opens the locker where I leave my uniform. I change. He watches. My casual everyday uniform goes back in the locker. I turn on the lights in the storefront and he unlocks the front door. The last thing I do, before the stroke of ten, is to haul the banners out from the back of the shop, one at a time, and stab them into the damp earth. </p>
<p>	When our work is done at the end of the day, we take them down and carry them inside. We leave them in a stack. The bird was just a puppet. Now it sleeps. Now it dies.</p>


<br><br>






<p>Sometimes I work up front in the store, but it’s better in the back, in the workshop. People and computers are opaque: they hide their intentions, and conceal their processes. I like the clear logic of a bicycle: there are physical inputs and physical outputs, conditions and procedures and mechanics that transform energy into utility. It’s exposed to the eye. It’s there to touch. There is no mystery. I don’t have a ride of my own yet, but I’ll earn the one of my choice at the end of my residency. Conviction Cycling is a skills-building and entrepreneurship program, whose mission is to teach the skills and mindsets necessary to everyday success.</p> 
<p>	While I work I listen to books on cassette tape. I can choose between a book by the founder of a middle-class coffee empire and a book by the founder of a middle-class hotel empire. I’ve heard them both. I listened to one then the other, then one then the other. The pattern got tedious so I heard the one a few times, again and again and again, and then the other. Then I went back to the one, and heard the one again and again, and again and again and again and again, and then the other. Then I switched which was which, and listened to one then the other then the other again and again, then I took a long break to study the sounds of ratchets and the whispers of the air pumps. Then I heard listened to one, then the other, and even tried reading along as far as I had memorized. In the Garden West resident library, everything is mechanical or biographical. Everything is suited to personal development and rehabilitation. We can check out the book by the founder of the middle-class coffee empire or the book by the founder of the middle-class hotel empire. This used to make me feel angry and helpless, but I don’t feel that way so often anymore. When I do feel angry and helpless, which is not so often anymore, I take myself back to moments of triumph, or project myself forward to the moment my potential will be fulfilled. This is a technique I heard from the founder of the middle-class coffee empire, intended for my development and rehabilitation, and it works. I don’t feel as angry and helpless. As much.</p>
	<p>As often.</p>
	<p>Anymore.</p> 

<br><br>

<p>Nancy 2’s company supplies the food. It’s a startup and an app called What Crumbs Around Goes Around. People from the city sign up to be supply requisitioners: they download the app, and then park behind a supermarket, and fill their cars out of their dumpster. They drive the long distance past the suburbs out to the Garden West campus and pull around to the loading dock. A Crumbs Around liaison weighs the delivery, plus bonuses for seasonal produce and hi-value nutrition items, and the next day they get paid out through their choice of payment apps. </p>
	<p>It’s a real win-win scenario: the state saves a buck, the drivers make a nickel, and Nancy 2 pockets the difference. Before she landed that contract, our food came from Civcon, Nancy 1’s company, one of those companies that supplies hospitals and universities and elementary schools. The variety was enormous, and the selection remarkable. Seven types of bread and six kinds of meat and four kinds of cheese and three vegetables and two fresh fruits and juice and milk and etc. However, it was almost all made of lentils and soy and corn syrup. Even some of the fruits were made of lentils and soy and corn syrup. </p>
<p>	Nancy 2 pitched her idea to the mayor and won the contract for herself by appealing to his sense of fiscal responsibility. Mayor Massey has won four consecutive terms by appealing again and again to a sense of fiscal responsibility. The voters adore him. No matter the platform of his opponent, he stonewalls their proposals by insisting that there is no money, and that the only way to raise the money would be to raise the taxes, and he’ll be darned if he’ll let big-government bureaucrats and hobgoblins get away with that one. No new taxes. Large sodas and free plastic bags, forever. And app freelancers (“solopreneurs”) are cheaper than union labor, and she passes the savings on to the city. So Mayor Massey liked Nancy 2’s plan to feed fresh secondhand food to the residents, and as a concession to her do-good nature he nominally supports such initiatives as the shop. </p>
	<p> Tucked into a row of crumbling warehouses and artisanal treat shops, Conviction lies between the city's atrophied industrial muscle and its whimsical, future-oriented experiments. Mayor Massey likes how the city eats itself and spits itself back up. He appreciates competition because defeat begets renewal. </p>
	<p>But Eastbank, so named for its spot on the hills high above the east edge of the river, has resisted real renewal. There's only one bridge between here and the central business/financial district; and the high-rise downtown condos that face Eastbank are always valued less than the ones that face away. For many years this area of the city has been just about to happen. It is always on the brink. If they (who?) built more bridges between here and downtown, to stitch our fates more closely together, Eastbank might emerge as a proud little bastion of civic potential. But that would demand vision and effort and money; so Eastbank will remain always on the brink, stretching out toward downtown, risking the long fall into the river below. </p>
<br><br><br>


<p>One day Nancy 2 came into the shop and breezed past Olli and Red at the front counter and found me in the shop and she looked around and didn’t see anywhere to sit. </p>
	<p>I wiped my hands on a black rag. I cleared off the workbench and sat on the edge, but she didn't join me. Nancy 2 always preferred to stand. She was always looking for the exit, with one hand on her bag and the other seeking a place to appropriately rest. She was uncomfortable everywhere. She always appeared in the wrong clothing: one layer too few during the winter, but long-sleeved with lined boots in the summer. On this day, an April day tailing out of winter's greedy grasp, she was in a wool sweater, with a thick red scarf noodled around her neck. She always appeared to be in a slapdash disguise.</p>
<p>	I had been the candidate that made the program possible. I'd been a resident for months before she took on her visiting-consultant role; and the director pointed me out as the rare resident both entrepreneurial and relatively untroublesome. I provided supporting evidence for her do-gooder not-for-profit nonsense, and she provided three days a week of sunlight and engagement. We knew we fed each other, and that common mission drew a small, comfortable circle around us. We laughed easily. We were comfortable side-by-side, and energized face-to-face. Today, though, she seemed a step too far away. Her baggy sweater made her look childlike and confused. She hitched her bag up on her shoulder and rested her other hand on her hip, then her neck; then she ran it through her hair, as though the first words she needed were buried somewhere within. </p>
<p>	‘Today Nancy 1 came into a board meeting,’ she said. Her sister had a token position on the board of Conviction; when she was there, according to Nancy 2, she usually sat in affected silence and applied and reapplied moisturizer to her hands and eyelids. ‘I was sitting at the head of the table, and she took one of the extra chairs by the wall and rolled herself right up next to me, much too close, and sort of nudged me out of the way and said she had an announcement. And then she leaned back and tried to shoo me away like a child. You remember how she leans back. She's always pointing and directing people from place to place, but she's always leaning back, as if she means to project power. Like she read it in a book that that's how you project power in a boardroom. She'll knock something off her desk and ask you to pick it up, point you toward it and ask but in a way that isn't really asking. You know, you remember how she is.'</p>
<p>	I nodded. I had met Nancy 2's older sister, Nancy 1, only once before. She had visited the shop. Nancy 2 had prepared me for the visit by explaining the twisted and bewildering circumstances of her older sister's divorce. Her husband had attempted to fake his own suicide, "drowning" himself in the river between downtown and Eastbank. He paid a witness to report his death to the police. They stood on the bridge late one night after Nancy 1 had gone to bed. He gave his witness a personal check for a hundred dollars, turned, and jumped into the water.</p>
<p>	Nancy 1's husband had been a diver in high school, but idleness and overconfidence disrupted his leap and he broke his leg hitting the surface of the water. Suddenly he was in a very real fight to survive. He called out to his accomplice but his accomplice couldn't hear him, and turned and started to run down the bridge toward downtown. He thrashed and struggled, and the water pulled at him like a hungry lover, and he had gulped two mouthfuls of water before he could manage a desperate side-stroke with the current. Eventually he reappeared on the bank south of downtown, near the place where the ham cannery dumps its slippery excesses into the rushing river. His leg was twisted and bleeding and his entire body was slick with lard. Nancy 1 arrived at the hospital with his "suicide note" in her hand, and by way of greeting they said in unison, 'I want a divorce.' </p>
<p>	Nancy 2 brushed her hair away from her eyes, and her bracelets rattled. </p>
<p>	When she visited the shop, Nancy 1 was cheery and charming. She showed her teeth and tossed her head as she laughed, and she laughed a lot; by her patient, engaged presence she found a seed of joy in everything we said. She strolled through the storefront and the workshop in innocent delight, twirling the pedals of the bicycles she passed, and asking questions comparing this model to that one and that style to another. As we reached the end of our walkthrough she pivoted to the cold business specifics; she prodded Nancy 2 with questions about quarterly mitigation and synthesized dividend insurance. Nancy 2 answered what she could but often had to dodge. Nancy 1 delighted in the chase. She asked further and further questions and softly marveled that her sister didn't know her secondary business metrics. I stepped in when I knew an answer. 'Thank you, Wellington,' she would snip, before directing another cruel inquiry to her younger sister. </p>
<p>	Neither of them wavered even around the most remorseless criminals and imaginative killers. They both saw how Olli and Red looked at her and never flinched.</p> 
<p>	Nancy 2 wrung one hand in the other. ‘She announced that Mayor Massey had signed a contract for her company to take over the logistics and operations at Garden West,’ she continued. ‘Her company, Civcon? That used to supply the cafeteria, now they’re going to operate the whole thing. They save money. So I imagine there are going to be some changes.’</p>
<p>	I looked around for something else to clean. Then I realized what I was doing, and forced myself to stop and unclench my fists and face her. </p>
<p>	‘They were very impressed with your work, Wellington, so I imagine nothing’s going to change here. The only thing is that I won’t be officially your advocate anymore. We’ll still be part of the same team, you and me and the guys. We’ve built a great thing here and as long as you keep it running smoothly, there’s no reason anything has to change.’ </p>
<p>	‘Anything else.’</p>
<p>	‘No reason.’ </p>
<p>	After she was gone, I asked the chaperone to come with me out into the back alley. It was the end of March, the end of the first quarter, and I wanted to test the emergency generator. I took a wrench from the workbench as we went out. The control panel was bolted to the back wall of the building; the generator was a squat aluminum box (bearing the CIVCON brand) a couple steps south of the back door. I popped open the panel cover and pressed the TEST switch. It started fine and the lights turned green. So I got into the box and disconnected a few of the big feeder cables between the unit and the building. Its control panel started to chirp helpfully, letting me know that it needed assistance to return to normal working order. ‘What’s that beeping?’ asked the guard. Indeed. ‘That means it’s working,’ I said. It continued to beep. ‘Really?’ he said. ‘Yeah,’ I answered, ‘they make these things obnoxious and loud because they assume the user is stupid. It’s insulting but it’s how it is.’ ‘I know what you mean,’ he said, ‘kind of the reason the resident attendants get batons instead of guns. The safety-scissor world. Nobody can be trusted with power.’ ‘Exactly,’ I said, ‘you know you could handle a gun, but nobody has ever given you the chance to prove yourself.’ ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘everything is just a question of liability.’ We talked loudly to be heard over the repetitive chirping. Finally it stopped. ‘All good here,’ I said, ‘thanks for taking the trouble.’ He turned to go back in first; as he pushed open the door I tucked my wrench behind the control panel door and snapped the lock shut.</p> 

<br><br><br>

<p>They closed the shop an entire month, to phase out Conviction and load in the new business. So for a month I looked at the tops of my shoes, and my feet faithfully carried me to every obligation and every block of my routine. At Garden West, “home,” the distant edge of the city far from the river and the shop and the high cold towers, it was surprisingly easy to slip into the routine without comment or resistance. I spoke only when spoken to and sought to avoid conflict and confrontation of all kinds. I ate everything on my plate without complaining. I made no display of my longing, although I felt as if I wore an image of the flat and bottomless abyss on my front. Light fell into me and did not escape. I was relieved that nobody asked me if anything was wrong. Was anything wrong? Something was wrong, but it was nothing unexpected or unusual. So was anything wrong at all? </p>
<p>	After the first two weeks I began to feel better in spite of myself. My fingernails were clean. My hands were not arrayed with scrapes and cuts and nicks. And in the sunny days, as spring matured, the guards lobbied for longer yard time, and got it, and the rest of us shared in it too. We laughed and played stickball, and after a few innings each day I went to the distant outfield to lie in the sun. To bathe in the light like a satiated tiger. I began to feel better in spite of myself. </p>
<p>	Then this ended, and I turned anxious. I worried what they had done to my shop. I worried whom they had hired for what purposes and where my tools and half-finished projects would go. I worried about the neat rows of bins where I had sorted the different washers, nuts, and bolts. They were all perfectly sorted by size and divided by color.  In my dreams I sorted vast, unending bins of washers and nuts and bolts, which would scramble themselves into disorder as soon as I turned my back. 
The food changed again; Nancy 1 and Civcon are our keepers now, and Nancy 2 and What Crumbs Around are obligated to pay their drivers but forbidden from feeding us their bounty. We went into the dining hall, and behind the windows instead of the usual selection of reclaimed grains and fruits there were a dozen steaming trays of brown slop. Each of us got a bowl of it and nothing else. I guess it was oatmeal. It was sort of like oatmeal. It wasn’t really like oatmeal at all. It was beige, if beige had a flavor. If you put kids’ glue in your mouth and someone whispered into your ear: “Beige.” Somewhere, I imagine, Nancy 2 is distraught. </p>
<p>	Indeed she was distraught. I saw her with her two assistants out by the loading dock. As every Wednesday morning, there was a queue of cars to drop off food from the supermarket dumpsters. As each driver pulled up and unloaded, the assistants weighed the food and signed for it. The drivers waved and honked as they departed, looking forward to their forthcoming direct deposits out of Nancy 2’s operating account. </p>
<p>	When the queue was empty, and they closed the loading dock door, Nancy 2 and her assistants loaded all the food into the garbage compactor. She herself flipped up the safety cover and slapped the big red button. </p>
<p>	The compactor has an alarm. It emits series of piercing beeps, like a forklift backing up, and the great hydraulic pumps smash its contents into thick little patties and discs and cubes of garbage. Then it sighs and releases, and the pumps retract, and the beeps fade. The machine emanates sexual contentment. </p>
<p>	If only if only the garbage compactor had had some kind of spigot, and I could have held my bowl under it as the day-old bread and ripe avocados and plump little berries and heat-lamp rotisserie chickens were smushed into one continuous, homogeneous grey mass of food-paste, I’d have done that, and it probably would have tasted better than filling my mouth with glue while someone whispered in my ear: “Beige.” As I picture it now, the person whispering in my ear is Nancy 2. I imagine the whisper and hear it. I turn my head and there she is. Beige to you too, Nancy 2.</p>

<br><br><br>


<p>Nancy 1 looked at us. We were standing for inspection so that we could go see the new business. Mayor Massey and local news crews would be there. </p>
<p>	‘You shouldn’t have let this one shave,’ she said, jerking her thumb at me. ‘On-camera, are you kidding me? We show this one with two days of beard and that image synergizes with the Civcon name in every 32-55-year old woman who watches local news.’ But she paused and frowned at me, and at the two eighteen-year-old guards on either side of us. ‘But there’s nothing we can do about it now. Let’s get to it, let’s get over there, chop-chop. Who’s driving?’ </p>
<p>	One guard looked at the other and the other guard looked at the one, and they looked at me and Olli and Red, standing there in unit-casual garb, hardly dressed up to travel, and then everyone looked at Nancy 1. One of the guards cleared his throat and ventured: ‘No, not me,’ and then other said, ‘Oh, I don’t have a car.’ </p>
<p>	‘Fine,’ snapped Nancy 1. ‘But you, go find someone who has a car, and trade places with whatever they’re doing. Look on the fleet app for who’s here and has a car.’ </p>
<p>	‘Sorry,’ he said, scrolling through tables on the fleet management app. ‘No, it looks like all of our drivers have called off today.’ </p>
<p>	Nancy 2 frowned and peered over his shoulder, as if she could see the loading dock through the many, many concrete walls in between. </p>
<p>	‘So,’ she said. ‘So all my drivers are using their cars to pick up groceries for Nancy 2’s ridiculous food-sharing app.' Her lip curled. So Civcon did not have its own fleet of company vehicles; all the Civcon cars were simply the employees’ own cars, and when they didn’t come to work, their equipment didn’t either. The guard thumbed through the fleet management and scheduling apps on his phone. ‘I can’t see where they are if they have the fleet app turned off--’ he began, but Nancy 1 said hush and pulled out her own phone. She looked and her lip curled higher. ‘Damn it,’ she said, punching the air and stamping her foot. </p>
<p>	‘Goddamn it!’ she cried, clutching the sky in her eggshell fists. The rest of us looked at each other, and then down. </p>
<p>	‘We could use a ride-share app,’ suggested Olli.</p>
<p>	‘There aren’t any ride-shares, either,’ began one of the guards--</p>
<p>	‘--because they’re all the same cars, goddamn it, they’re all the same cars!’ she snarled. The guards both put their phones down. She turned and began striding away toward the main entrance; we followed without knowing the plan. </p>
<p>	There are specialists for these logistics; and the stakes are high, which lends the setting to Hollywood cliché. Asset transit. He brings danger upon the convoy, but still must be protected, to imply the justice and security of society. But we stood there outside, me and Olli and Red dressed in guard uniforms along with the other two guards, and looked up and down the long, noodle-shaped street waiting for a checkered yellow taxi to arrive. </p>
<p>	For our protection, Nancy 1 procured three additional guard uniforms and ordered us to change again. We stood outside, me and Olli and Red dressed in guard uniforms just like the two actual Civcon guards, and looked up and down the long, noodle-shaped street waiting for a checkered yellow taxi to arrive. </p>
<p>	We stood there for a long time, and I saw my shadow grow shorter under the ascending sun. I could tell that Olli wanted to say something. He kept fussing with his collar, and then his pants; the collar was too tight, as Nancy 1 commanded that everyone button all the way up, and his pants were slightly misshapen and rode up in the crotch. It looked like his pants had been sewn in the dark. Seams which should have been parallel intersected and veered apart. In order to hitch them up around his waist, he had to tolerate a fair digging into his taint and balls area. The seams squeezed his balls in a bad way. He picked up one foot and then the other, and shamelessly adjusted his tuck like an unwilling jester about to go on. <p>
<p>	One of the guards grabbed Olli’s wrist and jabbed him in the thigh with a knee.</p> 
<p>	‘Lay off that. You’re making me nervous,’ he said. </p>
<p>	‘Oh, there’s really no limit for you, is there? Nothing is too petty. Let the man fix his balls,’ said Nancy 1. </p>
<p>	‘In the training video--’ began the guard. </p>
<p>	‘Hush,’ she said. ‘You see that? Taxi?’ She squinted at a white vehicle in the distance. It came closer. It was not a taxi, it was the US Postal Service, and it puttered past us on the way toward the loading dock, to join in the enormous and still-growing delivery line. </p>
<p>	At this, Nancy 1 reached down and plucked the high heels off her feet and put them in her bag. Barefoot, she started down the road in the direction of the city, her bag in the crook of her arm, her phone in the other hand, looking ready for a matinee at the light opera, or any kind of banal market-oriented philanthropy, or off to invest in a pet-luxury enterprise. She did not command us to follow, but we knew to follow, and we followed. </p>
<p>	Beyond the switchbacks there’s a bus stop. It’s the only bus between here and there. </p>
<p>	If it’s time to get picked up, and you can’t find someone to pick you up, you have to walk down the switchbacks and wait for the bus. The route used to run twice a day. Now the route runs once a day, and if your release takes a little too long to process, or you have a little too much stuff in your bag in a box in the vault, or you walk a little too slowly down the switchbacks, or the driver got ahead by zipping past the empty stops, you might miss it. You might miss your chance to ferry back into the city. You might get stuck here, newly free, with nowhere to go and night approaching. </p>
<p>	There was a man named Crane. When he checked in, his pockets were full of gold coins. When he checked out, they cross-checked each coin with the yellow carbon copy of that initial inventory and found that every one was accounted for. Crane checked his watch while the silent clerk made stacks of coins and counted softly by ones under his breath. During this remarkable exercise of conscientious best-practices, the bus came and went. </p>
<p>	Crane knew the truth from his watch and his memory, but still ran down the switchbacks after the inventory was complete. His pants flapped about his thin legs, and the outlines of his bones appeared in the fabric. The gold coins rattled and clacked in his trouser pockets, thousands of dollars’ worth. Under the midday sun he chased the edge of his shadow down the switchbacks toward the bus stop, the white stamped-steel sign standing beside a twisted tree. </p>
<p>	But the bus was late. With the sun shining through the hot, glassy midday, he saw it trundling and grumbling up the road, far off, and if he could dig deep and wave his arms he might be able to convince the driver to stop. Closer, he saw that the driver was a balding man, the front of him like the round slopes of a bathtub’s bottom, the uniform barely buttoned closed across his belly. Wrap-around sunglasses presented him like an elite athlete, or a mercenary specialist in some near-future overseas operation. The bus puttered and advanced. Crane began to gallop. He lost the discipline of his stride and took long, reaching steps that strained his muscles; they felt like the old, weather-beaten rope keeping the sails aloft, sails on a warship kept active for decorative and traditional purposes only. </p>
<p>	As he galloped and skipped down the slope and kicked up dust and ruined the hems of his pants, the insides his pockets bounced and boggled like a beagle’s ears. The coins began to jump out through the openings. They rolled away in every direction. They hid behind the rocks on the path. They tucked themselves in the weeds. They bounced on edge like tires in a cartoon car crash, bounced away and ahead of him toward the bus. </p>
<p>	The driver reached the bus stop while Crane had a full hundred meters to run. He tapped the brake and the vehicle hesitated; and then he pressed on the gas and pulled away.</p>
<p>	With nowhere to stay and nothing to do until the following day’s bus, 23 hours and 59 minutes off, Crane walked back up the slope, collecting as many of his coins as he could, and returned to the checkout clerk to ask if he could sleep in an empty cell. His cell had already been filled so they turned him away.</p>
<p>	His cell had already been filled so they turned him away. He spent the rest of the day picking his gold coins out of the bushes where he could; he got just a slender fraction of his money back, and the rest had rolled too deep into the brush or too far down the slope, to places which couldn't be reached and then returned. When it was finally dark, he sat at the foot of the tree and waited. </p>
<p>	In the morning, when the same driver brought the same bus back again, Crane was dirty and stiff, like an old book left outside through cycles of sun and rain. The suit had lost its pinched, awkward creases, but thick patches of dust coated the legs and back. The hard, bristly plants had shredded the cuffs of his pant legs, and picked ragged little holes out of his arms and sides.  Crane gave the bathtub-shaped man a gold coin and sat in the very last row, next to the window, because he couldn’t possibly sit any closer. He rode back to the city, dirty and abused, broke and exhausted, and free. </p>
<p>	But this is the same bus stop, with the same twisted and downcast tree whose upper branches have turned and grow toward the ground. Branches that want to be roots. At its tallest point, the tree curls over itself like fingers making a fist. </p>
<p>	This is where I waited for the bus with Red and Olli and two guards and Warden Nancy 1. And maybe the driver was not the same, but he was big and round and the button struggled to keep his blazer closed. He had wraparound sunglasses that hid his eyes. </p>

<br><br><br>
<p>Today a county inspector came to take samples of the drinking water. She ran the fountains in the yard, the canteen, and the bathroom, and took multiple samples from each. They’re in little clear plastic vials. She wore black latex gloves. Later, she carried all the samples away in a silver metal briefcase with foam inserts. Like she’s a jewel thief. The big white county van peeled out as it left through the loading dock, past a line of honking delivery drivers from What Crumbs Around. </p>

<br><br><br>


<p>Now you can apply for the beta wing. </p>
<p>	Beta wing is where they test the really radical ideas. At this point they've eschewed individual cells. There’s a big, central, open area, like the food court at a mall, or an ancient Roman courtyard with baths and the gymnasium and the old men talking about the Senate and the young men talking about the discus. And all the inhabitants of the beta wing mill about, going freely from activity to activity, monitored entirely by visual scanning and heat mapping and always-on listening devices that alert the single guard to specific misbehaviors by any individual resident. </p>
<p>	A guard looks at the report and the evidence and administers punishments and other tasks. </p>
<p>	The guard is at home using a laptop, clicking on pictures of the residents and typing notes into a form, putting tasks on the big digital display in the middle of the central mall. Sometimes one of these tasks will be a punishment. Punish so-and-so for a reward. And they punish so-and-so. They refrain from trades. They call him cruel, creative schoolyard names. Sometimes they beat him, and are rewarded with cigarettes, potato chips, and soda. </p>
<p>	At the end of the day, the residents pack up the different areas. The basketball hoops fold down and are stowed in the floor. The cafeteria carts are dumped out, scrubbed, rinsed and then stacked like pallets of widgets in a great warehouse. And when everything is in order, they pull beds out of the walls, like the drawer-cots in a big morgue. They sleep in the beds and roll them back in the morning.</p>
<p>	The day’s layout is projected onto the floor: cafeteria carts go inside the green outlines, chairs and tables inside the blue outlines, exercise equipment inside the yellow, and each morning the residents roll off their roll-out beds, shut them back into the walls, and work as a team to put the furniture onto the illuminated outlines, as though they were the run crew for a play that they themselves would perform: a raw, uncurated capture of the daily life inside of beta wing. </p>
<p>	When applications opened, they ran out of forms by the end of the first day. Now there’s a waiting list even to apply; and, if your application is approved, there is a waiting list for transfers, a queue for the spot that opens when someone is released, transferred back to general (as punishment), or dies. Only the really excellent candidates get into beta wing. </p>


<p>Nancy 2 had a tiny clipboard. She gave me a clipboard, too, but hers had a spreadsheet and mine had nothing on it. I looked at hers. The type was too tiny to read; the text crept and slid across the page like long lines of working ants. </p>
<p>	'Today we're going to work through the same puzzles that our guests will be doing,' she said. 'We'll work together without a timer, and go through each puzzle so all of us understand how they work, and how to support guests who need additional support.'</p>
<p>	She herded us all into the back. In the center of the shop there was a concrete cube, four walls with a gate, a window, and no ceiling. Inside, it was about ten feet square. Out through the "window" they'd painted a forest on the back wall of the shop. </p>
<p>	'Now, after guests sign waivers and give up their clothes--you take their clothes so they have nothing but their wits in there, and they put on the uniforms like you have--one of the "guards" (that's you) will herd them back through here. Did you know some people take these games so seriously they bring screwdrivers and pliers in their pockets and start taking the room apart when the timer begins? And some designers are expecting this sort of thing, and building red herrings into the game; and other designers actually make that rather pathological behavior into part of the game, and hide important clues where you’d need to have brought tools to get at them. Can you believe it? It’s unbelievable. We don’t want to get up to those kinds of shenanigans here; this is a really authentic set-up. Nancy 1 was obsessing about all the money she would save going with this theme, and obsessing double about how much more exciting the realistic setting would be than some kind of, I don’t know, mummy chase, or zombie apocalypse. She thought couples especially would respond to the scenario. So you make them empty their pockets, and you put everything into boxes, and then you give them their uniforms, and one final pocket check and wand before they go back into the game area. Then, one of the “other residents" (also you) will give the initial briefing, in-character. Olli, could you read the first briefing out-loud?'</p>
<p>	She gave Olli a five-stack of laminated 5x8 cards. He ahemed and held them up before his face. </p>
<p>	'"Yo, fools,"' he read. '"It's going down tonight: our boys outside are pulling up to cut the power. Emergency generators will take over but the electric locks will fail shut and most of the lights will go out. Your goal will be to break through the lock on your cell door and escape out through the maintenance area, where our homies will be waiting to pick us up. First up you should prolly find yall selves a flashlight. Then get to work on that electronic lock. Sixty minutes starts now."'</p>
<p>	'That's where the lights will shut off, with a very dramatic sound cue,' added Nancy. 'Thank you, Olli.' She took the cards. </p>
<p>	The game was simple enough. One of the guards, playing a guard, walked a route past the cell door, pointing a flashlight in front of him. Then another guard called to him, asking for help; the first guard put his flashlight down on the corridor credenza just barely reachable through the bars. Inside the flashlight was a rolled up piece of paper with a code; the code, unscrambled, suggests that there's a screwdriver in the pack of cigarettes under the mattress. The screwdriver opens the cover on the electronic lock; emergency instructions are encoded on the inside of the panel. Touch the wires to the batteries from the flashlight. The lock clicks open. The guard starts to come back (to add dramatic pressure, once they know you're nearing the end of the journey) and everyone slips quietly out through the cell door, along a lighted path, toward the sign that says exit. And the "exit" leads out into the alley, where the same guards (now dressed as gang hooligans) pile everyone into a little maintenance-diesel flatbed cart and drive you back to where you parked. Olli, Red, and I played the game badly on purpose; I watched the clock and we took well over 75 minutes to solve the puzzles we could have solved in twenty. Really we let the guards take the lead. We encouraged them toward dead ends and repeated to each other that we had no idea what to do next. Eventually they got most of the way there, with so little assistance from us, and Nancy 2 threw up her hands and cheered when we emerged from the back door into the sunny alley. It was a warm, sunny day, and we finished right at lunchtime, so we all sat in the bed of the cart and ate our sandwiches and potato chips and applesauce together. We all had the same meal, even Nancy 2. </p>
<p>	'Now let's imagine you didn't escape in time,' she said later, reaching up and pushing the darkroom timer’s second hand backwards. She flipped the switch and the old black clockbox ticked back to zero before uttering its long, piercing squawk. She had another stack of laminated notecards, which she gave to me. </p>
<p>	‘Thought you could get one over on us, did you? Well, we caught your buddies, and now it’s going to be bread & water for six weeks in solitary,’ I read. ‘Let that be a lesson to you. Gonna take a more resourceful mind than that to make it on the inside. Thank you for playing Jailbreak Escape; please follow me back out to the lobby. There you can take a look at our gift merchandise, which includes mousepads, t-shirts, and photos taken from the in-game cameras. See your group in action! Straight through there when you’re ready. Take your time, but please be courteous and remember there is another reservation directly after you.’ </p>
<p>	‘Thank you, Wellington,’ she said, plucking the cards out of my hand and putting them in order. ‘At the end of that, unlock the doors, leave them their belongings, and wait for them in the lobby. Don’t let them linger too long if there’s another reservation directly after them. Don’t let them linger too long anyway. Keep everything moving; the faster we get them in and out, you know, that’s how we’re making money.’ </p>

<br><br><br>

<p>This morning we saw the county water inspector again, flanked by her assistants in long black coats. She had a clipboard. One of them had her silver briefcase, and the other had a toolbox. They both wore sunglasses inside. They stalked down the hall toward the offices, like enforcers of an occupying army; a while later they stalked back and piled into their white van and peeled out of the loading dock, past a longer, honkinger line of delivery solopreneurs from What Crumbs Around. </p>
<p>	Later, we were playing stickball in the yard. Between innings I jogged over to the water fountain for a drink. I pressed the switch and no water came out. Same thing in the bathrooms and the canteen. No drinking water. The fountains are shut off. </p>
<p>	Now, each of us gets a 6oz bottle of Aquafina with breakfast and a 12oz bottle before lights-out. Olli has already found a source, and he is commanding a high price for additional sealed bottles of drinking water. Today there were four fights.</p>

<br><br><br>

<p>After my first escape attempt Warden Nancy 1 put me in beta wing. The guards here were heavily armed and armored. They had cattle prods and helmets with tinted visors, but their armor looked like catchers’ gear from a secondhand sporting goods store. </p>
<p>	When I arrived, they were piloting another work program for residents: this time, a digital work program, where we searched for given terms and clicked on links. We were supporting another of Nancy 1’s ventures: we searched for terms like “gluten tolerance pills,” “gluten intolerance pills,” “eat gluten safely pill,” and so on, and scrolled down the results until we found the result that led to her company, Borne & Bread. Then we clicked around on the store, pretending to look at the different products available, and clicked on any banner ads we saw. They’d reconfigured beta wing since the open-plan experiments; now, each resident had their own cell, with their own computer, and we were expected to be clicking when we were not sleeping. We woke up and clicked. We clicked while we ate. We clicked until we tipped forward at our desks, asleep. Somewhere else, someone looked at a report breaking down who clicked the most, who clicked the least, and which variable factors (food, lighting, sleep) led to most clicking. When one micro-study made advances--for example, the discovery that bananas facilitated faster, more accurate clicking than apples or pears--the change was implemented across the wing. For a week I ate nothing but bananas.</p>
<p>	When we clicked on the banner ads, or on any of the other search results, the computer threw up a big FORBIDDEN barrier. The only sites really accessible were the search engine, the results page, and anything on the Borne & Bread store. But the clicks on the ads were counted, and fractions of fractions of pennies accumulated at the distant bottom of Warden Nancy 1’s targeted advertising account. One day while I was doing this, I found that I could sneak past the controls by training the ads: if I searched for something else, like the next year's Bernadine model release schedule, that data would prompt the advertising service to show me ads for bikes. I could click the links and sometimes get through. </p>
<p>	I was reading about when a helmeted guard banged on the door with his cattle prod. I tried to Alt-Tab--an old reflex--but the Alt and Tab keys had both been popped off the keyboard. The guard was tapping his key fob against the electronic lock while I tried to navigate back to the bread store, but it was too late, I was caught like a firefly in a jar with a grenade. </p>
<p>	The door beeped. The guard pushed the door open and pointed with his cattle prod, indicating I should sit on the edge of the bed with my hands in view. I did. He swung the door shut behind him. He pulled his chest protector off and hung it over the viewport, shutting us off from the hallway.</p>
<p>	I’d never seen this particular maneuver, but the presentation was obvious enough, and I was about to get a serious extracurricular beating as a warm-up for the regularly-scheduled institutional punishment. Or maybe I’d be lucky, and the guard would thrash me without bothering to report my misbehavior, and I wouldn’t be facing additional time or even weirder implementations of the carceral project. The guard was smaller than me and the chest protector kept slipping down. He was trying to do it with one hand so he could keep the cattle prod out. But then he holstered it, to hold up the chestplate with both hands. I pounced. I saw my chance to turn today’s pain into a long-term investment. I could pay off today with a beatdown of my own and take the punishment as it came. What’s the difference? I’m an astronaut. I’m an astronaut. There are frontiers in two directions, space one way and Hell the other, and both types of pioneers make history. I tackled him and sat on him, my knees pinning his elbows to the ground. I pulled off the helmet. It was Nancy 2. Her hair clung to her face and she squeezed her eyes shut in anticipation of the blow, but she said my name, and she said stop, I’m here to help, and she said my name. </p>
<p>	We only had a minute to talk. </p>
<p>	She said: ‘I went to Crewpon, this coupon aggregator, and I set up a discount for the escape room. People always go fucking crazy for these deals because they make everything so cheap; but I made sure that this code is only active for one day. So the place is double-booked next Sunday. There’s no way that they’ll be able to turn over the place fast enough, offboarding one group and onboarding another at the same time, plus cleaning and resetting props. Olli and Red are good but they won’t be enough. Warden Nancy 1 has been neglecting the place ever since you came here. But she’ll look at the reservations, and once she sees the place is trending hard, she’ll need you. She’ll transfer you out on special reprieve to manage the place for one day.’ </p>
	<p>She stood up. 'Now I have to go,' she said, resting her helmet at the crown of her head like a football player. 'I'll send you instructions.' She masked herself, donned her armor, and went out. </p>
<p>	The next day I peeled the label off my bottled water and unfolded a ballpoint map of the shop, the back alley, and the blocks toward the north in the direction of the city. At the edge of the map an arrow said: to downtown. Another alley was marked with a drawing of a trash can. I memorized the map by tracing it on my leg with my fingertip while I clicked. I ate the paper. </p>


<p>On Sunday two masked and armored men retrieved me while I was clicking. They had their own vehicle. The vehicle took us to the shop, the former shop, where Olli and Red were already opening. Their usual chaperones where present. Mine changed into appropriate costumes, and didn't disarm. They each rested a beefy hand on their cattle prods like thuggish noblemen with their swords. </p>
<p>	When we unlocked the doors the first party had already arrived. Olli and Red, being in practice, did the character work. I scurried around the space, accompanied everywhere, setting the props, cleaning up, keeping our guests' things organized and tidy while they tried to teambuild their way out of the big false cage. My palms were sweating. I left wet prints on the props I handled. My feet were sweating; I felt them damp and hot inside my costume boots, which were slightly too big and slowed me down. The first group was quick; they completed their run in fifty-eight minutes. The second group was quicker; they were done in fifty. After their run, I pulled the darkroom timer down off the wall and unscrewed the back. I pried the second hand apart and replaced the gear with a slightly larger one from the back closet, to make that allotted hour more like forty-eight minutes. The third group didn't finish, and neither did the fourth, and then we usually would have taken lunch; but the schedule was tight, and we didn't break for lunch. I fielded another group, one led by a cheery drunk man with cherries for cheeks and wide, warm hands like pancakes. They gave me their clothes and phones and shoes and I packed them neatly into big plastic bags. They struggled in the cell and they failed. I returned their effects, and they filed out through the front door, laughing and smiling and promising to come back again. The cheery drunk man, who had led his group into every dead-end and talked over every good idea that dared emerge, slipped me a hundred dollar bill on his way out. He did it gracefully; nobody noticed. I got back behind the counter and tucked the bill into my shoe. </p>
<p>	The sabotaged clock distorted my temporal perception. I heard my own breathing and didn’t know if I was going too quickly or too slowly. Every group we had throughout the rest of the afternoon and evening failed, which had never happened before. I couldn’t help but think this an ill omen, watching so many innocent dozens fail to escape. They’d paid their admission and expected a fair sentence, but the system had deceived them and their hope was misguided. Thankfully, as I told myself again and again, there is no moral balance to the universe. I was not afraid of paying some kind of fated penalty for my role as a mendacious jailer, because none of the mendacious jailers I could see were paying any penalty for theirs. </p>
<p>	Nancy 2 cut the power when she said she would, right as the west horizon swallowed up the setting sun. The people inside gasped, all at once, like an offended audience. I went for the emergency exit. A guard stood in front of the door. ‘I have to start the generator. It won’t start automatically,’ I said. He didn’t move. ‘I’m the only one with the key to the panel,’ I said. He didn’t move. ‘If we leave these people locked up in the dark, we’re going to get terrible internet reviews,’ I said. He opened the door and followed me into the back alley. </p>
<p>	I opened the panel. I took out the wrench and clutched it close to my body. Over my shoulder I saw he was standing three steps behind me with his electric baton in his hand, lowered to the leg. I wouldn’t be able to reach him. </p>
	<p>‘Go peek in the door again,’ I said, ‘tell me if this does anything.’ He backed away, toward the back door to the shop, and as he glanced toward the safety window I turned and threw the wrench. It tumbled end-over-end like a knife and struck the back of his helmet dead-center. He staggered and went to a knee; by the time he turned, I was in the air, already coming down on top of him with my hands up and ready. </p>
<p>	I didn’t kill him or anything; I left him tucked under my orange costume jumpsuit, huddled on his side like a sleeping child, and I walked away in his baggy black pants and button-down uniform. </p>

<br><br><br>

<p>I walked until I decided it was safe to run. And I shut down that response almost immediately. That’s the kind of thing that gets you killed or caught. I kept walking, counting the streetlights, examining every sound that cascaded through the stillness like a buck that’s heard a branch crack. I kept walking. I counted the streetlights and turned left down the alley. There were two dumpsters facing each other, piled high; their lids stood at near-vertical angles like mouths awaiting surgery. </p>
<p>	Without a light I couldn’t search efficiently. I had to see with my hands. The first bags came off the pile easily. I began another neat pile adjacent to the dumpster. They were tied shut and secure and I thanked our postindustrial hygienic standards. After every few bags I paused to listen, and still heard nothing but the blood in my ears and the electricity jabbering through my entire nervous system. Sometimes the bags settled. It was difficult to work quickly and quietly at once and I felt certain that to compromise was to invite quick apprehension and definite doom. </p>
<p>	So I worked quickly, then quietly, then quickly, then quietly, sometimes hauling each bag off as if my own lungs and mouth were suffocated by their weight. Then I would look up and listen, and pluck the next few parcels off and lay them delicately down. And I would alternate and repeat. I found nothing. Beneath the first layer, the garbage was misshapen and wet. The black juices clung to my shaking hands. </p>
<p>	Near the bottom of the first dumpster--long after my neat auxiliary pile had become its own hazard--the ragged end of a can bit across the inside of my grip. I recoiled. I looked. A plump red line of blood crossed my four fingers above the palm. The blood ran down and mixed with the garbage juice. It was warm, and for a moment it was a pleasure, as the filthy fluid from the bags was so cold. </p>
<p>	But I didn’t have time. I clenched my fist shut, willing myself not to imagine the infections feasting into my blood, and kept hauling out one bag at a time. There was nothing in the first dumpster. I had known it from the beginning. I had known that the first would be empty. </p>
<p>	At the bottom of the second dumpster were two wheels, a chain, and a screwdriver. There were nuts and bolts scattered across the battered floor like dice. I hauled everything out and made a neat pile. Then I began to creep down the alley with one hand on the wall, feeling around the base of every streetlight. Around the last one--unlit like the rest--there was a chain, padlocked around a bicycle frame. Her key worked. </p>
<p>	I had to assemble the thing in darkness with a wounded hand; so I quietly worked until I heard the engines drawing close. Without an exit, and my tools and necessities too scattered to carry at once, I dug myself into the pile of bags and pulled one over my head like a blanket. I felt the drippings fall into my collar and wind down my chest and back. Once I was soaked enough, I didn’t mind the wait. I could have waited there for months. </p>

<br><br><br>
<p>In the misty dawn, the single bridge connecting Eastbank to downtown was almost empty; now and again, long black semitrucks would cross from one side to the other, alone or in long convoys of six or more. There were no logos or insignia anywhere. They didn’t putter and roar like diesel engines; they grumbled and buzzed softly, and left the morning intact. There was no sidewalk. I rode on the shoulder. Those long black trucks passed me on my left, tore the breeze across my face and chilled my wet skin. Below, the engine-grey water chopped and rolled over itself uneasily. I pedaled evenly and fast because I was seized by a grim vision, in which I stalled out, tipped over into traffic, and felt the semi’s many tires roll over and flatten my throat. I had not told Nancy 2 I did not know how to ride a bicycle. It was easier than I expected, but I vowed to be an evangelist for bike lanes for ever.</p>
<p>	I reached the downtown side with two black trucks on my left. I looked up. The driver, a round-faced blonde with chin-length hair emerging under a black cap, flashed a chubby thumbs-up and guided their vehicle to the south. The second truck continued going west, and up ahead turned toward the north. I kept my course, west, toward the center of the city. Almost nobody was awake. The cars sat still and cold, with mist resting heavy on their windows and hoods. It was as if all their owners were dead. At the street level, there were lights on in the entryways of the residential complexes and shops;  but up above, every window was dark. I rode in widening circles. I rode on the sidewalk, then in the gutter, then down the middle of the street, unnoticed and unbothered, and caught little glimpses of the long black trucks snaking through the industrial zones in the distance. Time passed but the sun did not come out. I needed a store, where I could get some new clothes and bandages and food, just enough things to restore me for an hour so I could spend a day preparing to make a plan for tomorrow. In the distance, wearing the mist, I saw a tall, sand-brick building wearing an enormous red neon bullseye, and I set my course. </p>
<p>	But as I approached I noticed other shops. Through the glass-paneled automatic doors I saw long shelves heavy with greeting cards and sneakers. Every shop sold everything. Every shop wore the same red bullseye on its front door. Every shop opened at seven, so I rode on looking for one that would open sooner. They were on every corner. None of them opened sooner. My legs ached for rest. I felt as if I were dragging myself through waist-deep sand; my pedals turned slowly, my body was heavy, gravity waited patiently to deliver the humiliating stroke and bring me to the ground. At the foot of the great tower there was another shop, just a little walkabout corner bodega with four modest aisles behind the red bullseye on the automatic glass door. I pulled up and tipped over and fell. On the ground I pried my shoe off my foot with both hands. The hundred-dollar bill was damp and limp but it felt sublime, heavy with potential in my hand like a gun. I regained my feet, swaying like a battered boxer, and staggered to the door. It didn't open. There was a young woman inside, sorting the greeting cards by occasion. She stared at me. She took a half-step back and twisted the envelope in her hand. I unrolled the bill and pressed Benjamin Franklin's face to the glass. She looked at me and at the locked door. She looked at the surveillance camera and the security monitor pointed at the entryway like a mirror to warn the visitor. Then she power-walked away, out of sight, and left me and Benjamin there with our noses against the glass.</p>


<p>God is an armless body with tree-trunk thighs. He is a deaf and sightless body with his bare feet on the pedals of the universe; and the universe is a sleek black bicycle, made of the night and painted sparse with stars. Sightless and deaf he pedals across the rainbow-bridge of time that stretches between the dawn of the first day and the final sunset. He cannot see the road. He knows neither his origin nor his destination. </p>
<p>	The bicycle of the universe has no brakes, and God’s feet are nailed to the pedals. He cannot stop. He does not coast. He cannot even will himself to fall. He pedals and pedals at a steady speed between the dawn and the dusk, and all the light of all the stars of all time crosses his marble skin, beautiful and unseen to his covered eyes forever.</p> 
<p>	He pedals and pedals the bicycle of the universe, emitting a constant, unending howl of pain for nobody to hear. He howls, and sucks in the air of the unseen planets to power another millennium of his long, agonized cry. He has no training wheels and no brakes. He has his blindfold and his nails and his breath. He hits a bump in the road. The bump is your fate. Your tiny, tragic, pathetic destiny sends a tiny, painful, kinetic shock straight to the balls of God. But He was already screaming in sacred agony. </p>

<br><br><br>

<p>She came back with a squat man in a red shirt and a black vest. He looked at me for a long time with a wise, impassive gaze; then he squeezed her arm and nodded. Together they approached the doors; he reached up and turned the lock. The doors parted, and the stale indoor air crashed over me like a great wave. The two of them stood back, shoulder-to-shoulder like a second set of doors, uncertain, as if I were a beaten dog ready to bite its benefactors. As I staggered inside, I looked upward into the security camera monitor, and saw the three of us hesitating there. We sniffed each other out and weighed the bonds. But after a moment the two of them stood aside, opening their arms and smiling, guiding me toward the many shining things they had for sale. </p>
